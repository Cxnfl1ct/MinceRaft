# MinceRaft
MinceRaft is a Minecraft clone written in the pure C.

> Be noted this project is still being worked on
> and can have any sort of glitches and/or misbehaviors.

The final objectives of this project are:
* Supporting 1.7.10 multiplayer protocol
* Supporting 1.7.10 worlds
* Supporting Microsoft auth systems

## Supported Platforms
MinceRaft supports the main 3 desktop platforms:
* Windows
* Linux
* MacOS

## Current bugs
* Nametags on players will be shown even if you're not looking at them

# Linux Users
* CD into the build folder
* run `./premake5 gmake`
* CD back to the root
* run `make`
* you are good to go

# MacOS Users
* CD into the build folder
* run `./premake5.osx gmake`
* CD back to the root
* run `make`
* you are good to go

# Output files
The built code will be in the bin dir

# Working directories and the resources folder
The example uses a utility function from `path_utils.h` that will find the resources dir and set it as the current working directory. This is very useful when starting out. If you wish to manage your own working directory you can simply remove the call to the function and the header.

# Building for other OpenGL targets
If you need to build for a different OpenGL version than the default (OpenGL 3.3) you can specify an OpenGL version in your premake command line. Just modify the bat file or add the following to your command line

## For OpenGL 1.1
`--graphics=opengl11`

## For OpenGL 2.1
`--graphics=opengl21`

## For OpenGL 4.3
`--graphics=opengl43`

## For OpenGLES 2.0
`--graphics=opengles2`

## For OpenGLES 3.0
`--graphics=opengles3`
